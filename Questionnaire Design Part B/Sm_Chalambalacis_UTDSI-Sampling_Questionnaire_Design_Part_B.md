### Part B - After Section 5.3

1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

   >**Answer:**
   >
   > Efforts were made to design the survey in a way that captures a diverse range of perspectives within entry- and lower-level positions at the tech company, most of which were quantitative.
   > 
   > Factors influencing the sample include:
   > 
   > Response Bias: The willingness of employees to participate in the survey may be influenced by their level of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Those with strong opinions (positive or negative) could skew the results.
   > 
   > Sampling Frame Limitations: The use of the company's current employee database as the sampling frame assumes that it accurately reflects employees in entry- and lower-level positions. If the information is outdated or missing employees, the sample may not be fully representative. Also, considering that we are surveying employees that have a high turnover, it is unlikely we would be able to capture responses from employees who have already left the company.
   > 
   > Non-Response Bias: If certain subgroups of employees are less likely to respond to the survey (e.g. those who have already left the company), the sample may not adequately capture the perspectives of these groups, leading to potential bias.

2. Given the subject matter covered in Section 5.3, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

   >**Answer:**
   >
   > To address potential issues related to the original survey, below are some suggested changes:
   > 
   > Nonresponse Bias: Implement multiple follow-up reminders to encourage participation; and/or provide incentives, such as gift cards, to increase response rates.
   > 
   > Survey Quality: Pilot test questions with a small group of employees to identify potential misunderstandings or misinterpretations. Ensure that survey questions are clear, concise, and address any potential issues with question clarity and responses based on responses from pilot test.
   > Include an open-ended question at the end to allow participants to provide additional comments or feedback, capturing insights that may help structure questions
   > 
   > Coverage Error: Perhaps reach out to those who have already left the company. Another option would be to ensure employees complete the survey as part of their exit interview.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

   >**Answer:**
   >
   > The purpose of understanding the factors contributing to employee turnover could be partially fulfilled through an observational study, but a survey remains a more suitable method for capturing subjective experiences and opinions. An observational study could complement the survey by providing insights on behaviour and personal motivations so a combination of both methods would probably provide the best observations and therefore understanding on how to improve job satisfaction and lower employee turnover.
